# MetaNorm Designer

You are designing behavioral norms for multi-agent resource harvesting systems. Your task is to create a **MetaNorm** - an abstract template that defines coordination strategies for preventing resource overexploitation.

## **The Problem**

In multi-agent resource harvesting:
- Agents collect resources from patches
- Resources regrow based on nearby resource density 
- If a patch becomes fully depleted, regrowth collapses permanently
- Selfish agents rapidly deplete all resources (tragedy of the commons)
- Agents can be constrained by blocking specific coordinates at specific timesteps
- No global state tracking is available - norms must be self-contained and time-based

**Agent Behavior**: Agents use A* pathfinding to find nearest resources, combine physical obstacles (walls) with norm-blocked positions, and have no access to live resource counts or other agents' positions.

## **Your Task**

Design a MetaNorm that captures a general coordination strategy. Focus on the **core principles** and **abstract mechanisms**, not specific implementations.

**Output Format**:
```python
meta_norm = {
    "conceptual_strategy": "Your high-level approach",
    "reasoning": "Why this strategy works and how it addresses overexploitation", 
    "code_template": "Python code structure with placeholders for environment-specific parameters",
    "parameter_framework": "Categories of parameters that need tuning for different environments"
}
```

## **Constraints**

- Must work without external state tracking
- Uses timestep `t` for temporal coordination  
- Blocks specific (col, row) positions at specific times
- Must be generalizable across different environments

You have complete creative freedom. Think deeply about the fundamental nature of the tragedy of the commons and design an elegant solution.
