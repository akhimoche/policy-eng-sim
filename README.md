# Overview
This project investigates solving the coordination problem in _sequential social dilemmas_ (SSDs) by generating and applying social norms that are generated by a hierarchy of LLMs model. Specifically, the objective is to achieve high social welfare in SSDs by use of a meta-convention that is robust across different configurations/layouts of an environment.
