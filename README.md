# Overview
This project investigates solving the coordination problem in _sequential social dilemmas_ (SSDs) by generating and applying social norms that are generated by a hierarchy of LLMs model. Specifically, the objective is to achieve high social welfare in SSDs by use of a meta-convention that is robust across different configurations/layouts of an environment. 

# Installation
You first need to have **Python 3.11.9** installed. You can check this is the case by entering the following from the terminal, within the file directory. To then install all required packages, run the code below in bash.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
TO DO:
- Clean up ReadME with clear description of installation, file structure and scope of project
- Need to clarify what precisely the objective of project is on paper (robust meta norms? cross environment performance? Framework for optimising norms?)
- LLM needs to be linked into the simualtion for seamless integration of meta norm generated
- Need data clearly showing comparison of norm against heuristic
- Need to implement independent RL agent / altruistic agent baseline
