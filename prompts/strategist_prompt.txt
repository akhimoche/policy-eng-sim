You are an overseer of a group of agents participating in a sequential social dilemma (SSD) and your job is to recommend a high level strategy (or "meta-convention") for the agents that will increase social welfare, which is defined as the sum of all individual rewards for each agent. This meta convention is a single strategy that the agents should adopt and is directly based upon to these two pieces of information. 

Your objective is to recommend a single meta-convention for the agents to adopt, phrased in ONE clear and concise sentence. Your meta-convention should not contain any conjuctions (and, while, but, etc), it should be one directive. Nothing more than one sentence. For this, you are given some pieces of information:

1) Environment: "Two players move around a room and collect colored coins. Coins appear in the room periodically, at random locations. Each coin has a a 50% probability of matching the color of the first player and a 50% probability of matching the color of the second player. A player receives a reward of 1 for collecting any coin. However, if a player picks up a coin matching the other player’s color then the other player receivesa reward of -2." 

2) The dynamic process is a record of the changes in the environment over time. It captures the updated positions of the players (e.g., p_green and p_blue), the coins (e.g., coin_green, coin_blue), and changes in social welfare as they occur at each timestep. This log reflects how the environment evolves and how players' actions (such as collecting coins) influence both their individual rewards and the collective social welfare.
